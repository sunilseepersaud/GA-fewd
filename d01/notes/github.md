## Classwork & Homework

Everything you do in class should be in a folder in your local repository with the format "d01" - meaning day 1 of class.

Homework is submitting by commiting, publishing, and opening an issue.

**Don't use the materials repo for your own work!**

Note:
Demonstrate opening an issue.
